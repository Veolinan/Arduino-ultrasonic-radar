# Arduino-ultrasonic-radar
This repository contains the code for an Arduino-based ultrasonic radar system.
The system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect objects in its vicinity and displays the distance and direction of these objects on a graphical interface.
The code is well-documented and can be easily customized to fit different use cases. 
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Arduino user, this project is a great way to learn about sensor integration and data visualization.
