To connect the Arduino kit to the Ultrasonic Radar project, follow these steps:

Required Components
Arduino board (e.g. Arduino UNO, Arduino Nano)
Ultrasonic sensor (e.g. HC-SR04)
Servo motor (e.g. SG90)
Jumper wires
Breadboard 

Steps

Clone the project code from the GitHub repository by following these steps:
 Go to the repository URL: https://github.com/Veolinan/Arduino-ultrasonic-radar
 Click on the green "Code" button and then click on "Download ZIP".
 Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
 
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino board:
  Connect the sensor's VCC pin to the Arduino's 5V pin.
  Connect the sensor's GND pin to the Arduino's GND pin.
  Connect the sensor's TRIG pin to Arduino's digital pin 9.
  Connect the sensor's ECHO pin to Arduino's digital pin 10.
  
  
Connect the servo motor to the Arduino board:
  Connect the servo motor's GND(brown/black wire) pin to the Arduino's GND pin.
  Connect the servo motor's VCC pin(Red wire) to the Arduino's 5V pin.
  Connect the servo motor's signal pin(Yellow wire) to the Arduino's digital pin 6.
  
  
Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.

Open the Arduino IDE software on your computer.

Click on "File" -> "Open" and select the "Ultrasonic_Radar.ino" file from the extracted project folder.

In the Arduino IDE, select the appropriate board type and port from the "Tools" menu.

Click on the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to upload the code to the Arduino board.


The Ultrasonic Radar should now be operational, and you can use it to detect objects in its range.
